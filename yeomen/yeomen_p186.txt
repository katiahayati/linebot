Point: Nay, Elsie, be comforted.  This Fairfax was but a pestilent fellow, and, as he had to die, he might as well die thus as any other way.  'Twas a good death.

Elsie: Still, he was my husband, and had he not been, he was nevertheless a living man, and now he is dead, and so, by your leave, my tears may flow unchidden, Master Point.

Fairfax: And thou didst see all this?

Point: Aye, with both eyes at once -- this and that.  The testimony of one eye is naught -- he may lie.  But when it is corroborated by the other, it is good evidence that none may gainsay.  Here are both present in court, ready to swear to him!

Phoebe: But art thou sure it was Colonel Fairfax?  Saw you his face?

Point: Aye, and a plaguey, ill-favoured face too.  A very hang-dog face -- a felon face -- a face to fright the headsman himself, and make him strike awry.  Oh, a plaguey, bad face, take my word for it.  How they laugh!  'Tis ever thus with simple folk -- an accepted wit has but to say "Pass the mustard," and they roar their ribs out!

Fairfax: If ever I come to life again, thou shalt pay for this, Master Point!

Point: Now, Elsie, thou art free to choose again, so behold me: I am young and well-favoured.  I have a pretty wit.  I can jest you, jibe you, quip you, crank you, wrack you, riddle you --

Fairfax: Tush, man, thou knowest not how to woo.  'Tis not to be done with time-worn jests and thread-bare sophistries; with quips, conundrums, rhymes, and paradoxes.  'Tis an art in itself, and must be studied gravely and conscientiously.
