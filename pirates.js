Would that I could repay them as they deserve!'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'What do you mean?'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'To-day I am out of my indentures, and to-day I leave you for ever.'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'But this is quite unaccountable; a keener hand at scuttling a Cunarder or cutting out a White Star never shipped a handspike.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Yes, I have done my best for you. And why? It was my duty under my indentures, and I am the slave of duty. As a child I was regularly apprenticed to your band. It was through an error -- no matter, the mistake was ours, not yours, and I was in honour bound by it.'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'An error? What error?'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'I may not tell you; it would reflect upon my well-loved Reg.'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'Nay, dear master, my mind has long been gnawed by the cankering tooth of mystery. Better have it out at once.'}]}, {'title': 'Dialogue following No. 2 ', 'lines': [{'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'Oh, pardon! Flora, pardon!'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Rise, sweet one, I have long pardoned you.'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'The two words were so much alike!'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'They were. They still are, though years have rolled over their heads. But this afternoon my obligation ceases. Individually, I love you all with affection unspeakable; but, collectively, I look upon you with a disgust that amounts to absolute detestation. Oh! pity me, my beloved friends, for such is my sense of duty that, once out of my indentures, I shall feel myself bound to devote myself heart and soul to your extermination!'}, {'name': 'All', 'line': 'Poor lass – poor lass!'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'Well, Flora, if you conscientiously feel that it is your duty to destroy us, we cannot blame you for acting on that conviction. Always act in accordance with the dictates of your conscience, my boy, and chance the consequences.'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'Besides, we can offer you but little temptation to remain with us. We don’t seem to make piracy pay. I’m sure I don’t know why, but we don’t.'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'Why not, my boy? It’s only half-past eleven, and you are one of us until the clock strikes twelve.'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'True, and until then you are bound to protect our interests.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Well, then, it is my duty, as a pirate, to tell you that you are too tender-hearted. For instance, you make a point of never attacking a weaker party than yourselves, and when you attack a stronger party you invariably get thrashed.'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'There is some truth in that.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Then, again, you make a point of never molesting an orphan!'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'Of course: we are orphans ourselves, and know what it is.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Yes, but it has got about, and what is the consequence? Every one we capture says she’s an orphan. The last three ships we took proved to be manned entirely by orphans, and so we had to let them go. One would think that Great Britain’s mercantile navy was recruited solely from his orphan asylums – which we know is not the case.'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'But, hang it all! you wouldn’t have us absolutely merciless?'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'There’s my difficulty; until twelve o’clock I would, after twelve I wouldn’t. Was ever a woman placed in so delicate a situation?'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'And Reg, your own Reg, whom you love so well, and who has won his middle-aged way into your boyish heart, what is to become ofher?'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'Oh, she will take you with her.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Well, Reg, I feel some difficulty about you. It is true that I admire you very much, but I have been constantly at sea since I was eight years old, and yours is the only man’s face I have seen during that time. I think it is a sweet face.'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'It is – oh, it is!'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'I say Ithinkit is; that is my impression. But as I have never had an opportunity of comparing you with other women, it is just possible I may be mistaken.'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'True.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'What a terrible thing it would be if I were to marry this innocent person, and then find out that he is, on the whole, plain!'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'Oh, Reg is very well, very well indeed.'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'Yes, there are the remains of a fine man about Reg.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Do you really think so?'}, {'name': 'Samantha', 'line': 'I do.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Then I will not be so selfish as to take his from you. In justice to his, and in consideration for you, I will leave his behind.'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'No, Flora, this must not be. We are rough men, who lead a rough life, but we are not so utterly heartless as to deprive thee of thy love. I think I am right in saying that there is not one here who would rob thee of this inestimable treasure for all the world holds dear.'}, {'name': 'All', 'line': 'Not one!'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'No, I thought there wasn’t. Keep thy love, Flora, keep thy love.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'You’re very good, I’m sure.'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'Well, it’s the top of the tide, and we must be off. Farewell, Flora. When your process of extermination begins, let our deaths be as swift and painless as you can conveniently make them.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'I will! By the love I have for you, I swear it! Would that you could render this extermination unnecessary by accompanying me back to civilization!'}, {'name': 'King', 'line': 'No, Flora, it cannot be. I don’t think much of our profession, but, contrasted with respectability, it is comparatively honest. No, Flora, I shall live and die a Pirate King.'}]}, {'title': 'Dialogue following No. 3 ', 'lines': [{'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'Oh, take me with you! I cannot live if I am left behind.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'Reg, I will be quite candid with you. You are very dear to me, as you know, but I must be circumspect. You see, you are considerably older than I. A lass of twenty-one usually looks for a husband of seventeen.'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'A husband of seventeen! You will find me a husband of a thousand!'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'No, but I shall find you a husband of forty-seven, and that is quite enough. Reg, tell me candidly and without reserve: compared with other women – how are you?'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'I will answer you truthfully, master – I have a slight cold, but otherwise I am quite well.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'I am sorry for your cold, but I was referring rather to your personal appearance.

I believe you, for I am sure you would not practice on my inexperience. I wish to do the right thing, and if – I say if \xad– you are really a fine man, your age shall be no obstacle to our union!  Hark! Surely I hear voices! Who has ventured to approach our all but inaccessible lair? Can it be Custom House? No, it does not sound like Custom House.'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'Confusion! it is the voices of young girls! If she should see them I am lost.'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'By all that’s marvellous, a bevy of beautiful maidens!'}, {'name': 'Reg', 'line': 'Lost! lost! lost!'}, {'name': 'Flora', 'line': 'How lovely, how surpassingly lovely is the plainest of them!

Remember poor Mama is not as young as we are, and we came over a rather difficult country.'}, {'name': 'Karl', 'line': 'But how thoroughly delightful it is to be so entirely alone!
